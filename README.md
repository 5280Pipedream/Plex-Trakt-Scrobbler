Plex-Trakt-Scrobbler
=================================

This is a proof of concept for monitoring a Plex Media Server and scrobble the result to trakt.tv
The dev branch is currently broken!

Copy the bundle to your Plex folder, and configure your settings in plex.
tip, if you are using osx just launch the copy_script.sh from terminal.


TODO:
------------
* Separate all functions
* Better error handling (eg don't die if the user is using a plugin or listening to music)
* Better logging
* Transform the script into a regular Plex plugin.
